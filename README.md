# 📂 Prompts Library

This folder contains reusable, high-performance prompt templates organized by domain. Each prompt is designed to uncover or extend latent capabilities in large language models, based on the Prompt Mechanic 2.0 methodology.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Rather than simply instructing the model, these prompts aim to **excavate suppressed abilities**, overcome default behavior patterns, and provoke novel output using advanced prompting techniques.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `coding/` — Prompts for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and algorithmic thinking.
- `writing/` — Prompts for creative writing, storytelling, rhetorical experimentation, etc.
- `analysis/` — Prompts for critical reasoning, synthesis, and constraint exploration.

## 📄 Prompt Format

Each prompt file should follow this structure in Markdown:

```markdown
# Prompt Title

## Description
Brief explanation of the prompt's intent and capabilities it targets.
